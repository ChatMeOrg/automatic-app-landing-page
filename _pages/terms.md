Welcome to ChatWithMe - the app that enables you to call your friends more often (“**we**,” “**us**” or “**our**”).

These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) apply to your access and use of the mobile application (the “**App**”) and services (collectively, the “**Service**”) of ChatWithMe. 


## **Accepting these terms**

By downloading the app or using the service, you agree the terms listed below. Please read all of the terms before you use the Service. If you don’t agree to all of the terms and conditions listed below, please don’t use the Service.

 


## **Modifications**

We reserve the right to change our Terms of Service from time to time. For example, we may need to change these Terms if we come out with a new feature. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review these Terms periodically to stay informed about our practices. 

Whenever we make changes to these Terms, they are effective when the revised Terms are posted unless we notify you otherwise. If you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms have been posted, then you will be deemed to have accepted the changes to these Terms.

## **General**

Enforcement of these Terms is solely at ChatWithMe’s discretion. Failure to enforce any part of these Terms in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the same or other part of these Terms in other instances. If any provision of these Terms is or becomes unlawful, void or otherwise unenforceable (including the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations above), then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect. The section headings of these Terms are for reference purposes only and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms. 

These Terms (and the other policies and terms referred to above) make up the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service, and they supersede any prior agreements that may have been made.
