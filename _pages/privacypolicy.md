# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: 31 October 2020**

Welcome to ChatWithMe - the app that enables you to call your friends more often (“**we**,” “**us**” or “**our**”).

These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) apply to your access and use of the mobile application (the “**App**”) and services (collectively, the “**Service**”) of ChatWithMe. 

 


## ACCEPTING THESE TERMS

**BY DOWNLOADING THE APP OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS BELOW. **Please read all of the terms before you use the Service. If a term does not make sense to you, please let us know. If you don’t agree to all of the terms below, you may not use the Service. 

 


## MODIFICATIONS

We reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time. For example, we may need to change these Terms if we come out with a new feature. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review these Terms periodically to stay informed about our practices. 

Whenever we make changes to these Terms, they are effective when the revised Terms are posted unless we notify you otherwise. If you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms have been posted, then you will be deemed to have accepted the changes to these Terms.

 


## DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE 

Through the App, you can select your favorite contacts and--if this is reciprocated by your contacts--see their activity status (‘Willing to chat’ or ‘Not available’). You can also set your own status to let your favorites know about your availability.

By using the Service, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this privacy policy.
